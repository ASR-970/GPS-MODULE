Mobile GPS-Based Location Tracking

This project serves as an efficient alternative to GPS modules like the Neo-6M, enabling location data collection from a mobile device and transferring it to a Python script in Google Colab for further processing, including AI/ML applications.

How It Works
The system retrieves GPS coordinates from a mobile device.
The collected data is sent to a Python script running in Google Colab.
AI/ML algorithms process the location data for further analysis.

Steps to Run
1. Execute the Google Colab script and obtain the free public Ngrok URL.

2. Copy the generated URL and update it in the JavaScript and HTML files.

3. Run the index.html file.

4. The location data will be transmitted to Google Colab for processing.
Important Note

Ensure that the Google Colab notebook remains active while the script is running to maintain data transfer.
